The CORE project was derived from the open source IMUNES project from the
University of Zagreb in 2004. In 2006, changes for CORE were released back to
that project, some items of which were adopted. Marko Zec <zec@fer.hr> is the
primary developer from the University of Zagreb responsible for the IMUNES
(GUI) and VirtNet (kernel) projects. Ana Kukec and Miljenko Mikuc are known
contributors.

Jeff Ahrenholz has been the primary Boeing
developer of CORE, and has written this manual. Tom Goff
designed the Python framework and has made significant
contributions. Claudiu Danilov, Rod Santiago,
Kevin Larson, Gary Pei, Phil Spagnolo, and Ian Chakeres 
have contributed code to CORE. Dan Mackley helped 
develop the CORE API, originally to interface with a simulator. 
Jae Kim and Tom Henderson
have supervised the project and provided direction.
