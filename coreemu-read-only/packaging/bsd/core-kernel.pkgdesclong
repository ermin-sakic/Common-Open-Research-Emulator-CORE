This package contains the CORE FreeBSD kernel with kernel modules. Custom modules include ng_pipe and ng_wlan. Also contains the userspace utility program vimage. This package can be used along with the CORE GUI to build emulated networks. This kernel is based on the GENERIC kernel with the VIMAGE option turned on (per-jail network stack virtualization), and with a small patch to allow per-node filesystem access.
