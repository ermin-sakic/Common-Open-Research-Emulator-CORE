More complete documentation is available in the ng_pipe(4) man page.

This version of ng_pipe has been modified as follows:
- added burst rate (or burstiness) which is the probability that the next packet
  will be dropped given an error with the current packet, 0 to 100
- added jitter effect, which randomizes the delay an additional amount from
  0 to jitter microseconds
- ng_wlan support added, to remove and read mbuf tags containing wlan link
  effect information
- bugfix: random number generation improved from defective modulo algorithm
- bugfix: fixed mbuf dangling pointer reference when ng_pipe has both duplicates
  and errors configured
