== ABOUT =======================================================================
CORE is a tool for emulating networks using a GUI or Python scripts. The CORE
project site (1) is a good source of introductory information, with a manual,
screenshots, and demos about this software. Also a supplemental
Google Code page (2) hosts a wiki, blog, bug tracker, and quickstart guide.

== BUILDING CORE ===============================================================

To build this software you should use:

  ./bootstrap.sh
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install

Here is what is installed with 'make install':

  /usr/local/bin/core-gui
  /usr/local/sbin/core-daemon
  /usr/local/sbin/[vcmd, vnoded, coresendmsg, core-cleanup.sh]
  /usr/local/lib/core/*
  /usr/local/share/core/*
  /usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/core/*
  /usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/[netns,vcmd].so
  /etc/core/*
  /etc/init.d/core

See the manual for the software required for building CORE.


== RUNNING CORE ================================================================

First start the CORE services:

  sudo /etc/init.d/core-daemon start

This automatically runs the core-daemon program. 
Assuming the GUI is in your PATH, run the CORE GUI by typing the following:

  core-gui

This launches the CORE GUI. You do not need to run the GUI as root.

== SUPPORT =====================================================================
