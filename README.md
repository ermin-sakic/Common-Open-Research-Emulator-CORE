# Common Open Research Emulator (CORE) Mirror

The Common Open Research Emulator (CORE) is a tool for emulating networks on one or more machines. You can connect these emulated networks to live networks. CORE consists of a GUI for drawing topologies of lightweight virtual machines, and Python modules for scripting network emulation. 

CORE has been developed by a Network Technology research group that is part of the Boeing Research and Technology division. The Naval Research Laboratory is supporting further development of this open source project.
